@article{hummels_adaptive_2012,
	abstract = {We carry out adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations of Milky Way mass halos in order to investigate the formation of disk-like galaxies in a Λ-dominated cold dark matter model. We evolve a suite of five halos to z = 0 and find a gas disk formation in each; however, in agreement with previous smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations (that did not include a subgrid feedback model), the rotation curves of all halos are centrally peaked due to a massive spheroidal component. Our standard model includes radiative cooling and star formation, but no feedback. We further investigate this angular momentum problem by systematically modifying various simulation parameters including: (1) spatial resolution, ranging from 1700 to 212 pc; (2) an additional pressure component to ensure that the Jeans length is always resolved; (3) low star formation efficiency, going down to 0.1\%; (4) fixed physical resolution as opposed to comoving resolution; (5) a supernova feedback model that injects thermal energy to the local cell; and (6) a subgrid feedback model which suppresses cooling in the immediate vicinity of a star formation event. Of all of these, we find that only the last (cooling suppression) has any impact on the massive spheroidal component. In particular, a simulation with cooling suppression and feedback results in a rotation curve that, while still peaked, is considerably reduced from our standard runs.},

@article{kiuchi_large-scale_2024,
	abstract = {The merger of two neutron stars launches a relativistic jet, which must be driven by a strong large-scale magnetic field. However, the magnetohydrodynamical mechanism required to build up this magnetic field remains uncertain. By performing an ab initio super-high-resolution neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics merger simulation in full general relativity, we show that the αΩ dynamo mechanism, driven by the magnetorotational instability, builds up the large-scale magnetic field inside the long-lived remnant of the binary neutron star merger. As a result, the magnetic field induces a Poynting-flux-dominated relativistic outflow with an isotropic equivalent luminosity of {\textasciitilde}1052 erg s−1 and a magnetically driven post-merger mass ejection of {\textasciitilde}0.1 M⊙. Therefore, the magnetar hypothesis, in which an ultra-strongly magnetized neutron star drives a relativistic jet in binary neutron star mergers, is possible. Magnetars can be the engines of short, hard gamma-ray bursts, and they should be associated with very bright kilonovae, which current telescopes could observe. Therefore, this scenario is testable in future observations.},

@article{jannaud_numerical_2025,
	abstract = {The magnetorotational instability (MRI) plays a crucial role in the evolution of many types of accretion discs. It is often studied using ideal-MHD numerical simulations. In principle, such simulations should be numerically converged, i.e. their properties should not change with resolution. Convergence is often assessed via the MRI quality factor, Q, the ratio of the Alfv{\'e}n length to the grid-cell size. If it is above a certain threshold, the simulation is deemed numerically converged. In this paper, we argue that the quality factor is not a good indicator of numerical convergence. First, we test the performance of the quality factor on simulations known to be unconverged, i.e. local ideal-MHD simulations with zero net-flux, and show that their Qs are well over the typical convergence threshold. The quality-factor test thus fails in these cases. Second, we take issue with the linear theory underpinning the use of Q, which posits a constant vertical field. This is a poor approximation in real nonlinear simulations, where the vertical field can vary rapidly in space and generically exhibits zeros. We calculate the linear MRI modes in such cases and show that the MRI can reach near-maximal growth rates at arbitrarily small scales. Yet, the quality factor assumes a single and well-defined scale, near the Alfv{\'e}n length, below which the MRI cannot grow. We discuss other criticisms and suggest a modified quality factor that addresses some, though not all, of these issues.},
