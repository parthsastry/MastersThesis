%%  THE ABSTRACT
%%  ============
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.4 Abstract
%%  --------------
%%  The thesis or dissertation must contain an abstract -- a concise summary of
%%  the thesis or dissertation intended to inform a prospective reader about
%%  its content. It usually includes a brief description of the problem
%%  investigated, the procedures or methods used, the findings, and the
%%  conclusions. It may use one or a few paragraphs; however, it is very rare
%%  that an abstract should use more than two pages, and many use just one page. 
%%
\abstract[short]{%
  The file umassdthesis.cls is a modification of the standard \LaTeX\ thesis
  class file.  This particular class file incorporates all of the requirements
  of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth for graduate level Master theses
  and Ph.\ D.\ dissertations, as well as undergraduate Honors and senior theses.

  The thesis or dissertation must contain an abstract -- a concise summary of
  the thesis or dissertation intended to inform a prospective reader about its
  contents.  It usually includes a brief description of the problem
  investigated, the procedures or methods used, the findings, and the
  conclusions.  It may use one or a few paragraphs; however, it is very rare
  that an abstract should use more than two pages, and many use just one page.

  The {\tt $\backslash$abstract} command for the umassdthesis class  has an
  optional argument of {\tt long} for abstracts that go beyond a single page.
  The default is {\tt short}.

%%
%%  THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%%  ====================
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.5 Acknowledgments
%%  ---------------------
%%  Short statements of acknowledgment of indebtedness (eg. thanks to one's
%%  thesis or dissertation advisor, to other professors, to people who have
%%  given support) may appear on a separate page right after the abstract. An
%%  acknowledgments section is required if the author has received permission to
%%  use previously copyrighted material or is obliged to acknowledge grant
%%  sources. This section is present in most theses or dissertations and is used
%%  to express a very specific professional or personal indebtedness. For
%%  example, significant instances of collaboration with one or more others in
%%  one's thesis or dissertation work would probably need acknowledgment in a
%%  Preface (see 5.1.8) or in this Acknowledgments section for example, research
%%  undertaken together with another student or use of much material from some
%%  other investigator.
%%
%%  The acknowledgements should be written in a professional manner. When
%%  writing the acknowledgments, be sure that your use of "person"ù is
%%  consistent.  If you begin with references to yourself as "the author",
%%  continue to use third person throughout. If you begin with first person
%%  ("I", "me", "my") use first person consistently.  There are two accepted
%%  spellings of the word "acknowledgments"ù (the other is "acknowledgements");
%%  be sure to spell this word consistently.
%%
\acknowledgements{%
  Here's where you acknowledge all the people who helped you. It should
  probably include your thesis advisor as well as the senior students and
  post-docs who actually supervised your research project.  Short and sweet is
  the best bet here, thank too many people and they're lost in the crowd.
  Mentioning your family and friends at this point is always a good idea since
  this is about as far as they'll ever get in reading your thesis. 
%%  the emply line before the closing brace is REQUIRED to ensure that 
%%  the formating of the acknowledgments page is done correcty

%%
%%  THE PREFACE (optional)
%%  ======================
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.8 Preface (optional)
%%  ------------------------
%%  Most theses or dissertations will not have a Preface, which is called for
%%  only for unusual reasons, eg., when the genesis of the work needs to be
%%  explained or when the author's contribution to a multiple-authored work must
%%  be noted. If there is a preface, however, it would incorporate any
%%  acknowledgments instead of those appearing as a separate section.
%%  
%%  Preface sections are rarely used.  The first chapter (sometimes called
%%  "Introduction") in the text section is the appropriate place for
%%  explanations of the context or the motivations that underlie the research,
%%  the research problem, the background of previous scholarship, notable
%%  contributions by other scholars, and so forth. Use a "Preface" section only
%%  for special purposes beyond such purposes as these; examples of such a
%%  special purpose are covered in sections 7.4 and 8.5.
%%  
%%
%%  7.4 Translations by the Author of Material Used
%%  ----------------------------------------------- 
%%  Material that you translate is still the intellectual property of the
%%  author. It must be documented fully (its original-language source cited
%%  properly and included in the bibliography). An appropriate note indicates by
%%  whom it has been translated, by you or someone else. If a thesis or
%%  dissertation will have extensive use of such material, this might be an
%%  occasion for an explanation in a Preface.  Usually, translators of published
%%  works will be indicated in the standard documentation of your notes and/or
%%  bibliography.
%% 
%%  8.5 Collaborative Work That Will Appear in a Thesis or Dissertation
%%  -------------------------------------------------------------------
%%  A thesis or dissertation must represent work done principally if not
%%  entirely by the author. When there are minor instances of research
%%  collaboration, an appropriate citation may be used. If extensive, however,
%%  the committee must approve it in detail and an explanation in a Preface
%%  section is called for (see sections 5.1.8).
%% 
%%  
%%  The preface should be written in a professional manner. When writing the
%%  acknowledgments, be sure that your use of "person" is consistent.  If you
%%  begin with references to yourself as "the author"ù continue to use third
%%  person throughout. If you begin with first person ("I", "me", "my"), use
%%  first person consistently.

%%%  done the preface !!


%%
%%  THE EPIGRAPH (optional)
%%  =======================
%%
%%  Some authors include a quotation (epigraph) or illustration (frontispiece)
%%  as the last of their preliminary pages. Neither should be listed in the
%%  table of contents, although a frontispiece may be included in the list of
%%  illustrations. The source of an epigraph is indicated below the quotation
%%  but is not listed in the bibliography or references unless it is also
%%  cited in the text. A page number need not be shown, but the page is
%%  counted in the sequential page numbering.

%%  The default option is a epigraph (text).
%%  The two LaTeX commands below will produce the same output.

%%  Everything after this is an appendix
%%  ------------------------------------

%%%
%%%  If there is just ONE appendix use the \singleappendix command

%\singleappendix
%\chapter{The Only Appendix}
%
%If there is only one appendix, it is called ``Appendix'' (not ``Appendix
%A'').  
%
%To achieve this, use the command, {\tt $\backslash$singleappendix}
%
%\section{Appendictical Numbering}
%\label{sample-appendix:numbering-section}
%
%The command, {\tt $\backslash$singleappendix} prints the appendix title without
%the trailing A.
%
%\section{Getting the labels right \ldots}
%
%The {\tt $\backslash$singleappendix} command also ensures that the section and
%subsection numbers don't include a leading A. and that the the Table of
%Contents, List of Figures and List of Tables entries for section, subsection,
%equations, figures and tables don't have a leading period.

\chapter{Additional Material
\label{sample-appendix}}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sample-appendix:introduction-section}

This is a sample appendix. By adding the command $\backslash$appendix to the
\LaTeX\ file before this file is included, the Table of Contents will
reflect the appendical nature now attained. 

\section{Appendictical Numbering}
\label{sample-appendix:numbering-section}

Appendices are labeled alphabetically rather than numerically as with chapters.
Each is identified separately as ``Appendix A'', ``Appendix B'', and so forth. 

\section{Getting the labels right \ldots}

Sections in the first appendix will be labeled A.1, A.2 etc.  Similarly,
subsections, equations, figures and tables will have a leading A.   This will
be reflected in the Table of Contents, List of Figures and List of Tables in
the prologue pages.



\chapter{The Second Appendix}

This is labeled Appendix B.

\section{A Section} 

Sections within this are labeled B.1

\section{A Nother Section} 

Additional sections are labeled B.2 \ldots
