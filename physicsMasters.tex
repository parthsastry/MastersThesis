%%  THE ABSTRACT
%%  ============
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.4 Abstract
%%  --------------
%%  The thesis or dissertation must contain an abstract -- a concise summary of
%%  the thesis or dissertation intended to inform a prospective reader about
%%  its content. It usually includes a brief description of the problem
%%  investigated, the procedures or methods used, the findings, and the
%%  conclusions. It may use one or a few paragraphs; however, it is very rare
%%  that an abstract should use more than two pages, and many use just one page. 
%%
\abstract[short]{%
  Accretion is a fundamental source of energy in astrophysics, powering disks in systems ranging from moons to low-mass stellar binaries to disks around supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Accretion is challenging to model accurately from first principles, making numerical simulations a key tool in investigating turbulent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluctuations driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Resolving the critical length scale associated with this instability is essential to capturing its growth and dynamics. In this work, we utilize the multi physics code FLASH to model accretion disks in idealized two-dimensional simulations and adaptively refine our simulation domain using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), based upon resolution of the MRI. We then compare the AMR simulations to simulations which uniformly resolve the computational domain everywhere, and thereby showcase the possible computational savings of utilizing AMR in future MRI simulations.

%%  THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%%  ====================
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.5 Acknowledgments
%%  ---------------------
%%  Short statements of acknowledgment of indebtedness (eg. thanks to one's
%%  thesis or dissertation advisor, to other professors, to people who have
%%  given support) may appear on a separate page right after the abstract. An
%%  acknowledgments section is required if the author has received permission to
%%  use previously copyrighted material or is obliged to acknowledge grant
%%  sources. This section is present in most theses or dissertations and is used
%%  to express a very specific professional or personal indebtedness. For
%%  example, significant instances of collaboration with one or more others in
%%  one's thesis or dissertation work would probably need acknowledgment in a
%%  Preface (see 5.1.8) or in this Acknowledgments section for example, research
%%  undertaken together with another student or use of much material from some
%%  other investigator.
%%
%%  The acknowledgements should be written in a professional manner. When
%%  writing the acknowledgments, be sure that your use of "person"� is
%%  consistent.  If you begin with references to yourself as "the author",
%%  continue to use third person throughout. If you begin with first person
%%  ("I", "me", "my") use first person consistently.  There are two accepted
%%  spellings of the word "acknowledgments"� (the other is "acknowledgements");
%%  be sure to spell this word consistently.
%%
\acknowledgements{%
I would like to profusely thank Professor Robert Fisher for guiding me through this work and for being as patient with me as an advisor could be. His encouragement in the face of personal hardship and his guidance as I switched fields from Physics to Oceanography has been invaluable.

I am grateful also to my current advisor - Professor Amit Tandon for extending the opportunity to me to pursue my current Doctor of Philosophy project and for allowing me to pursue this project to its completion, in fact encouraging me to do so. I am supremely thankful for both these amazing mentors I have met on my graduate school journey.

I would also like to thank Professor Sean Couch at Michigan State University who extended to us the opportunity to test out their group's version of the FLASH software in our initial exploration of what simulations were possible for this project. I would also extend my gratitude to the organizers of the NSF/APS-DPP GPAP Summer School in 2023, which was invaluable in my theoretical understanding of the field of plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics in particular.

I would like to thank Mark Ugalino and Vrutant Mehta for their guidance as I initially got acclimatized to the lab and the software I used, and for being excellent seniors in general. I also extend my sincere and frankly, insufficient, thanks to all the friends I have made in graduate school. I shall name Siddhant Kerhalkar, Debarshi Sarkar, Drake Ssempijja and Krut Patel in particular for their friendship through the journey of writing this thesis.

I am most thankful, however, to my parents, without whose support and love none of this would be possible.

This work utilized resources from Unity, a collaborative, multi-institutional high-performance computing cluster managed by UMass Amherst Research Computing and Data. Part of this work was conducted while I was supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) N00014-22-1-2012 grant to UMass Dartmouth MUST (3) program.

%%  THE PREFACE (optional)
%%  ======================
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.8 Preface (optional)
%%  ------------------------
%%  Most theses or dissertations will not have a Preface, which is called for
%%  only for unusual reasons, eg., when the genesis of the work needs to be
%%  explained or when the author's contribution to a multiple-authored work must
%%  be noted. If there is a preface, however, it would incorporate any
%%  acknowledgments instead of those appearing as a separate section.
%%  
%%  Preface sections are rarely used.  The first chapter (sometimes called
%%  "Introduction") in the text section is the appropriate place for
%%  explanations of the context or the motivations that underlie the research,
%%  the research problem, the background of previous scholarship, notable
%%  contributions by other scholars, and so forth. Use a "Preface" section only
%%  for special purposes beyond such purposes as these; examples of such a
%%  special purpose are covered in sections 7.4 and 8.5.
%%  
%%
%%  7.4 Translations by the Author of Material Used
%%  ----------------------------------------------- 
%%  Material that you translate is still the intellectual property of the
%%  author. It must be documented fully (its original-language source cited
%%  properly and included in the bibliography). An appropriate note indicates by
%%  whom it has been translated, by you or someone else. If a thesis or
%%  dissertation will have extensive use of such material, this might be an
%%  occasion for an explanation in a Preface.  Usually, translators of published
%%  works will be indicated in the standard documentation of your notes and/or
%%  bibliography.
%% 
%%  8.5 Collaborative Work That Will Appear in a Thesis or Dissertation
%%  -------------------------------------------------------------------
%%  A thesis or dissertation must represent work done principally if not
%%  entirely by the author. When there are minor instances of research
%%  collaboration, an appropriate citation may be used. If extensive, however,
%%  the committee must approve it in detail and an explanation in a Preface
%%  section is called for (see sections 5.1.8).
%% 
%%  
%%  The preface should be written in a professional manner. When writing the
%%  acknowledgments, be sure that your use of "person" is consistent.  If you
%%  begin with references to yourself as "the author"� continue to use third
%%  person throughout. If you begin with first person ("I", "me", "my"), use
%%  first person consistently.

%%
%%  THE EPIGRAPH (optional)
%%  =======================
%%
%%  Some authors include a quotation (epigraph) or illustration (frontispiece)
%%  as the last of their preliminary pages. Neither should be listed in the
%%  table of contents, although a frontispiece may be included in the list of
%%  illustrations. The source of an epigraph is indicated below the quotation
%%  but is not listed in the bibliography or references unless it is also
%%  cited in the text. A page number need not be shown, but the page is
%%  counted in the sequential page numbering.

%%  The default option is a epigraph (text).
%%  The two LaTeX commands below will produce the same output.

%%  Everything after this is an appendix
%%  ------------------------------------

%%%
%%%  If there is just ONE appendix use the \singleappendix command
%%%
%\singleappendix
%\chapter{The Only Appendix}
%
%If there is only one appendix, it is called ``Appendix'' (not ``Appendix
%A'').  
%
%To achieve this, use the command, {\tt $\backslash$singleappendix}
%
%\section{Appendictical Numbering}
%\label{sample-appendix:numbering-section}
%
%The command, {\tt $\backslash$singleappendix} prints the appendix title without
%the trailing A.
%
%\section{Getting the labels right \ldots}
%
%The {\tt $\backslash$singleappendix} command also ensures that the section and
%subsection numbers don't include a leading A. and that the the Table of
%Contents, List of Figures and List of Tables entries for section, subsection,
%equations, figures and tables don't have a leading period.
